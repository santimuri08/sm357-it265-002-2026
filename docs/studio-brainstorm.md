- **Chosen Name**: ColCraft Studio
- **About the name**: I chose this name because it has personal significance. Col means Colombia, where I am from. I wanted to put this to represent my culture. Craft is more significant than the game mechanics. So the name gives both things, like personal
  and universal meaning.
