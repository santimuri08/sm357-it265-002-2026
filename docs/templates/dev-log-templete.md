#### Goals for this Module
- [ Create an idea of a possible name for our game project ] 
- [ Think about what type of game we want to make for our project ] 
- [ have some type of brainstorm of ideas of the style, themes, and design for our game ]

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - I was able to select a name that has a great meaning of what I want 
  - Was able to have some type of start of where I want my game to be about or at least to
    have some type of idea.
  - Also, to understand how my studio can be unique and different from others
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Choosing a name was hard, and it was harder when I needed to select like 6.
  -  Selecting the tools to make it.
  -  Checking if the name was used already was hard too, since cound't find an actual media online
- **Solutions**:
  - The name was selected, like with the initials of my Country, and giving that as the meaning
  - After my research, I ended up selecting the tools for beginners in the video game creation.
  - I also focus on unique and simple ideas for the brainstorm.

#### Learnings
- I learned how to plan or like to get ideas for a game studio, like finding the name, style, and other.
-  I learned about some tools that are used for different aspects in video game making,
  like for the visual, audio, or other aspects. 

#### Free Thinking
- Getting some feedback from users to know if the idea works.
- Check the latest trends on games to understand more about what people like
